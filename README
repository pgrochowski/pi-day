Pi Day

Pi day is on the 14th of March in 2015 (3/14/15) because the date spells out the first 5 numbers of pi. This scheme can also be extended to the time 9:26:53.

In celebration of this once in a long time event, this repository contains a simple program to calculate pi using a variant of the Leibniz formula for pi.

See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leibniz_formula_for_%CF%80 for more details.

Enjoy!
